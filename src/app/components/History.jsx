        <p>
          Pizza Stop was born out of a love for pizza, family, and
          tradition. Founded in 2022, by Albert Calabrese, a third-generation
          pizzaiolo from Naples, we have been serving the Boca Raton
          community with pizzas that tell a tale of passion and heritage. Our
          founder's vision was simple yet profound: to recreate the warmth of his
          grandmother's kitchen for every guest who walked through our doors.
